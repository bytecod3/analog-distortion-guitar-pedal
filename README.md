This is a mono analog guitar distortion pedal.

It contains a tunable low pass filter with a BW of 2KHz, gain ranging from 20dB to 40dB, an NPN transistor amplifier stage, an analog clipping circuit for waveform distortion and an output volume control knob.

Input and output is fed by a 6.35mm TRS audio jack.
